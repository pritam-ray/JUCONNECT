# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for JU_CONNECT

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. ✅ Code pushed to GitHub repository (`pritam-ray/JUCONNECT`)
2. ⚠️ GitHub Pages enabled (needs setup)
3. ⚠️ Supabase environment variables configured (needs setup)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/pritam-ray/JUCONNECT
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the settings

### Step 2: Add Supabase Environment Variables

1. In your repository, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret** and add these secrets:

#### Required Secrets:
```
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: [Your Supabase Project URL]
Example: https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
```

```
Name: VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
Value: [Your Supabase Anonymous Key]
Example: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

#### Where to find these values:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment

After adding the secrets:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. If not, click **Run workflow** manually

### Step 4: Access Your Site

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
```
https://pritam-ray.github.io/JUCONNECT/
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Deployment

### Check Deployment Status:
1. **Actions Tab**: See build and deployment progress
2. **Deployments**: View deployment history and status
3. **Pages Settings**: Confirm GitHub Pages is active

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### ❌ Build Fails
- Check if all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify no TypeScript errors
- Review build logs in Actions tab

#### ❌ Site Loads but Supabase Errors
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Check Supabase project is active
- Confirm database migrations are applied

#### ❌ 404 Errors on Navigation
- `.nojekyll` file is included (✅ already added)
- Vite config has correct base path (✅ already configured)

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

Every time you push to the `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions automatically builds the project
2. Runs tests and checks
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
4. Site updates within 1-2 minutes

## 🛠️ Local Development vs Production

### Local Development:
```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Production Build Test:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  
# Test production build locally
```

### GitHub Pages:
```
https://pritam-ray.github.io/JUCONNECT/
# Live production site
```

## 📊 Performance & Analytics

Consider adding:
- Google Analytics for user tracking
- Sentry for error monitoring
- Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Supabase keys are stored as GitHub secrets (secure)
- Anonymous key is safe for client-side use
- RLS policies protect database access
- HTTPS enabled by default on GitHub Pages

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test the deployed site** thoroughly
2. **Apply database migrations** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Set up the cleanup Edge Function** for automatic data retention
4. **Monitor the Actions tab** for any deployment issues
5. **Share the live URL** with users!

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Domain: `https://pritam-ray.github.io/JUCONNECT/`
- Build time: ~2-3 minutes per deployment
- Auto-deploys on every push to `main` branch
- Requires Supabase project to be active for full functionality

Ready to deploy! Just follow the setup steps above. 🚀
